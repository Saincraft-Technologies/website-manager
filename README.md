## Introduction

The Website Manager backend is designed to facilitate the management of website information for an organization. It allows third-party entities to manage website-related content. The backend is built using Node.js and follows RESTful principles. It communicates with a database to store and retrieve website data.

## Usage

To use the Website Manager backend, third-party entities can send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or any other backend testing tool. Make sure to include the required headers and parameters based on the endpoint documentation.

## Authentication

The Website Manager backend uses token-based authentication to secure the endpoints. To access protected endpoints, third-party entities need to include an authentication token in the request headers.

The site manager has to be registered on the Saincraft Website Manager and use the account to view bills, update content to the site.

## Conclusion

The Website Manager backend provides a simple and straightforward way to manage and maintain your website hosted with us.

If you have any further questions or need additional information, please refer to the backend documentation or contact the backend developers.
