## Introduction

The Revenue Collection API is designed to facilitate the collection of revenue information for an organization. It allows third-party entities to manage revenue-related data when collecting revenue on your behalf. The API is built using Node.js and follows RESTful principles. It communicates with a database to store and retrieve revenue data.

## Installation

To install and run the Revenue Collection API on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd revenue-collection-api`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure the environment variables by creating a `.env` file. Include the necessary configuration, such as database connection details and authentication settings.
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To use the Revenue Collection API, third-party entities can send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or any other API testing tool. Make sure to include the required headers and parameters based on the endpoint documentation.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for managing revenue data:

- `GET /revenues`: Retrieve all revenue records.
- `GET /revenues/:id`: Retrieve a specific revenue record by its ID.
- `POST /revenues`: Create a new revenue record.
- `PUT /revenues/:id`: Update a specific revenue record by its ID.
- `DELETE /revenues/:id`: Delete a specific revenue record by its ID.

## Authentication

The Revenue Collection API uses token-based authentication to secure the endpoints. To access protected endpoints, third-party entities need to include an authentication token in the request headers.

Authentication tokens can be obtained by sending a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials. The API will respond with an access token, which should be included in subsequent requests using the `Authorization` header.

## Error Handling

The API follows standard HTTP error status codes for indicating errors. If an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate status code along with an error message in the response body.

Make sure to handle errors gracefully in your application by checking the status codes and response messages.

## Conclusion

The Revenue Collection API provides a simple and straightforward way for third-party entities to manage revenue data when collecting revenue on your behalf. With the provided endpoints, you can create, retrieve, update, and delete revenue records as needed. Use the authentication mechanism to secure your API and ensure only authorized third parties can access protected endpoints.
